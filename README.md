# UYF-SimpleInfo
A [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=requirements) mod for Until You Fall that puts various things like the names and or descriptions of the rewards in text files or the health in a html file for use in your streaming software like OBS.

# How to use
The files are located in:
Until You Fall\UserData\SimpleInfo\

To use the txt files simply add a Text source in OBS and in the properties of that source set it to "Read from file". Click Browse and select the txt file you want to display on your stream

Here's an example for the settings of the Text source:

To display the html files on your stream add a Browser source in OBS, in the properties of this source put a checkmark infront of Local file and select the  desired html
file.
<br/>You can change the images used for the displays by removing the ones that come with the mod and renaming the images you want to use to the names of the original ones.

Here's an example for the settings of the Browser source:
